--Q1. How many races happened in UK between 1990 and 2005 (both side inclusive)?
select count(*) from races 
where year <= 2005
    and year >= 1990 ;
--Q2. How many pole has Lewis Hamilton won? (pole means position 1 in the qualifying game)
select count(*) from results 
join drivers on drivers.driverId = results.driverId
where results.driverId = "1"
    and position <= "1";
--Q3. Which driver has been disqualified from the races the most? Print the name and the count. Hint: disqualified is a status in the status table.
select forename, surname, count(results.statusId) from drivers
join results on drivers.driverId = results.driverId
where results.statusId = "2"
group by results.driverId, results.statusId
order by count(results.statusId) DESC
limit 1;

--Q4. Which country hosts the race that has the most pitstops in one race? Print the country name, race name, race year, and the total number of pitstops in that race. 
--Note: Pitstop is something that happens during a race to, e.g., change tires. In each race, any driver can stop for 1 or more times. 
select country, c.name, r.year, count(p.stop) from circuits c
join races r on r.circuitID = c.circuitID
join pitstops p on p.raceID = r.raceID
group by p.raceID, p.stop
order by count(p.stop) DESC
limit 1;

--Q5. Print the final constructor standing in 2013 ordered from highest to lowest points. Print the constructor names and the points.
--Hint: The final point of a constructor is the total number of points this constructor gets over all races that year. 
--The points in constructor_results represent the points earned in a single race. The points in constructor_standings represent the accumulative point up to that race.
--The result should be consistent with https://www.formula1.com/en/results.html/2013/team.html
